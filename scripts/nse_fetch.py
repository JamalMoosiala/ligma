"""
nse_fetch.py

Plain `requests`-based client for NSE's public JSON endpoints -- no
nsepython/nsepythonserver dependency. This was a deliberate rewrite after
live debugging showed:

1. The classic option-chain endpoint (option-chain-indices) returns an
   empty {} even when hit directly, from BOTH a GitHub Actions cloud
   runner AND a residential IP -- it's very likely simply retired on
   NSE's side, not "blocked."
2. A newer endpoint (NextApi/apiClient/GetQuoteApi, functionName=
   getSymbolDerivativesData) DOES return real, live, full option-chain
   data -- confirmed with live output during debugging. nse_optionchain_
   scrapper() (from nsepython/nsepythonserver) apparently wraps this
   endpoint internally but its own reshaping logic was returning {}
   regardless -- a library bug, not an NSE/IP problem.
3. This project's own bhavcopy downloader (scraper.py) has been reliably
   pulling NSE data from GitHub Actions the whole time, using nothing
   more exotic than: a requests.Session(), a real browser User-Agent, and
   visiting nseindia.com first to collect cookies before hitting the
   actual target URL. This module ports that exact proven pattern to the
   live API endpoints instead of assuming a special cloud-workaround
   library was ever necessary.

IMPORTANT DATA LIMITATION: the working option-chain endpoint above does
NOT include bid/ask (no live two-sided quote) or NSE's own published IV.
Both were available from the old (now-dead) endpoint. This means:
- IV/Greeks are solved from LTP only -- there's no mid-price to prefer
  over it anymore, since there's no bid/ask at all.
- The below-intrinsic-value guardrail in greeks.implied_vol() is now the
  ONLY protection against a bad price -- it still works fine (only needs
  LTP), it just can't distinguish "thin/wide quote" from "no quote"
  anymore, since there's no quote to inspect.
- nse_iv is always None going forward -- the cross-check column has
  nothing to cross-check against with this data source.
See run_fetch.py and the README data dictionary for how this is reflected
in the output columns.
